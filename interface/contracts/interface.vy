An interface is a set of function definitions used to enable communication between smart contracts
A contract interface defines all of that contractâ€™s externally available functions

# @notice Interface with the Uniswapv2 factory contract
# @notice That contract is used to create new token pair contracts for swapping on Uniswap

# @notice That contract manages a liquidity pool made up of reserves of two ERC-20 tokens
# @notice It allows you to swap one of the pair tokens for the other, following the constant product formula
